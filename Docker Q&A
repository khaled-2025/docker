Scenario Based Interview Questions:
=================================================
1. Scenario:

=> You are managing a Docker cluster with several containers running. One of the containers crashes repeatedly, and you need to troubleshoot the issue. How would you approach this problem?

ðŸ’¥ Answer:

=> Inspect Container Logs:

- First, inspect the logs of the crashing container using the docker logs command.
- This provides valuable information about what might be causing the issue.

=> Check Resource Constraints: 

- Verify if the container is running out of resources, such as CPU or memory.
- Use the "docker stats" command to monitor resource usage. If necessary, adjust resource limits in the container configuration.

=> Review Docker Events:

- Check Docker events using the docker events command to see if there are any unusual activities or errors related to the container.

=> Update Container Image:

-  Ensure that the container is running the latest image version.
-  Pull the latest image from the registry and recreate the container if necessary.

=> Examine Configuration: 

- Review the container's configuration, including environment variables, volume mounts, and network settings. Make sure all configurations are correct.

=> Security Scanning: 

- Run a security scan on the Docker image to check for known vulnerabilities. Tools like Clair or Trivy can help identify potential security issues in the image.


=> Process Inside Container:

- If necessary, access the container using "docker exec" and examine the processes running inside.
- This can help identify specific issues within the container.
=================================================
2. Scenario: 

=> You want to scale a Dockerized application during periods of high traffic.
What is your approach to auto-scaling containers in a Docker swarm or Kubernetes cluster?

ðŸ’¥ Answer:

For both Docker swarm and Kubernetes, the approach to auto-scaling is quite similar:

=> Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (Kubernetes) / Service Replicas (Docker Swarm): 

- Configure auto-scaling policies based on metrics like CPU usage, memory usage,
or custom application metrics. When resource thresholds are exceeded, 
new pods (Kubernetes) or replicas (Docker Swarm) are automatically created.

=> Load Balancing:

- Ensure that your application is behind a load balancer. When new containers are spun up,
the load balancer distributes traffic to them, providing high availability and distributing load.

=> Cluster Monitoring: 

- Implement cluster monitoring using tools like Prometheus and Grafana (Kubernetes) or Docker Swarm's built-in monitoring.
- Set up alerts to trigger auto-scaling when metrics breach predefined thresholds.

=> Limit Resources: 

- Set resource limits for containers to prevent overutilization of cluster resources and ensure that auto-scaled containers are well-behaved.

=> Stateless Applications:

- Ensure that your application is designed to be stateless and can handle multiple instances running simultaneously.
- Data persistence should be managed separately (e.g. in a database or object storage).

Auto-scaling allows your infrastructure to adapt to changing demand, providing a seamless and efficient experience for users.
=================================================
3. Scenario: You have a multi-container application where services need to communicate with each other.
How would you set up networking between Docker containers?

ðŸ’¥ Answer:

1. Create a Docker Network:
Create a user-defined bridge network to enable communication between containers.
Example: docker network create my-network

2. Run Containers on the Same Network:
Run containers on the created network using --network <network-name> option in docker run command.

Example:
$ docker run -d --network my-network --name service-1 my-service-1:latest
$ docker run -d --network my-network --name service-2 my-service-2:latest
Containers on the same network can communicate using container names as hostnames.
=================================================
4. Scenario: You want to persist data generated by a Docker container. How would you achieve data persistence?

ðŸ’¥ Answer:

1. Volumes: 

- Create a named volume or bind mount to persist data.
- Named Volume:

$ docker volume create my-volume
$ docker run -d -v my-volume:/path/in/container --name my-container my-image:tag

- Bind Mount:

$ docker run -d -v /host/path:/container/path --name my-container my-image:tag

2. Docker Compose: Utilize Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications and their volumes.
Example docker-compose.yml:

version: '3'
services:
  my-service:
    image: my-image:tag
    volumes:
      - my-volume:/path/in/container
volumes:
  my-volume:
