Use a restart policy:

To configure the restart policy for a container,use the --restart flag when using the docker run command.
The value of the --restart flag can be any of the following:

1. no: Do not automatically restart the container. (the default)

2. on-failure[:max-retries] : Restart the container if it exits due to an error, which manifests as a non-zero exit code. 
but won't restart if you manually stopped it. however will restart if the docker daemon restarts
Optionally, limit the number of times the Docker daemon attempts to restart the container using the :max-retries option.

3. always: 
- the container will always restart if the main process is killed from inside the container. but won't restart if manually stopped.
- will estart if the docker daemon restarts.

4. unless-stopped:

- Similar to always, except that when the container is stopped (manually or otherwise), it is not restarted even after Docker daemon restarts.
